	Things to research:
	<ul> 
		<li> WebGL, how to use it, and the whole shebang</li>
		<li> How to get WebGL to work in a normal ass website</li>
		<li> possibly creating multiple pages in a larger projects category? unclear! </li>
	</ul>
	
	Things to have, just generally:
	
	<ul> 
		<li> Want to have code snippets from a buncha different projects; </li>
		<ul> 
			<li> CSE 125 project, of course </li>

			<li> The android app from that one class? idk remember it super well </li>
